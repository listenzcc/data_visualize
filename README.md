# Data Visualize

Visualize data of pandas using plotly

## Data generation

We simulate an active closed-circle economy zone.
Population exchange their wealth at a fixed frequency.
**Wealth data** is collected during the simulation.

## Data visualization

The **Wealth data** is recorded in pandas format and displayed in plotly as **web-end** and **interactive** charts.

Wish me a good luck.
